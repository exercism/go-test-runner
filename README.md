# Exercism's Go Test Runner

This is [Exercism's test runner](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/tree/master/anatomy/track-tooling/test-runners#test-runners) for the Go track.

## Executing the Test Runner

The test runner requires 2 parameters:
- `input_dir`: the path containing the solution to test
- `output_dir`: the output path for the test results

### Local Development

```bash
go run . ./testdata/practice/passing outdir
```

### Docker

To `build` execute the following from the repository `root` directory:

```bash
docker build -t exercism/go-test-runner .
```

Run the test runner in the container by passing in the slug name, and absolute paths to the exercise (solution) and a writeable tmp directory. These directories should be mounted as volumes:

```bash
docker run --network none --read-only -v $(pwd)/testdata/practice/gigasecond:/solution -v /tmp:/tmp exercism/go-test-runner gigasecond /solution /tmp
```

For troubleshooting / debug you can name the container, run it in interactive mode, and detach from it using:

```bash
docker run --name exercism-go-test-runner -d -i --network none --read-only -v $(pwd)/testdata/practice/gigasecond:/solution -v /tmp:/tmp exercism/go-test-runner gigasecond /solution /tmp
# You can then access the container as follows:
docker exec -it --user appuser $(docker ps -q --filter name=exercism-go-test-runner) /bin/sh
```


## Subtests

The test runner is responsible for [returning the `test_code` field](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/anatomy/track-tooling/test-runners/interface.md#command), which should be a copy of the test code corresponding to each test result. 

For top-level tests, the AST is used to return the function code directly. For [tests containing subtests](https://blog.golang.org/subtests), additional processing is required. To ease the burden of advanced AST processing on unstructured / non deterministic test code, subtests should adhere to the following specification. If a test employs subtests, do not mix it with test or other code outside of the Run() call. Subtests not meeting the spec will be treated as top-level tests, with the entire test function code being returned for every subtest. At some point, we may [implement a static analyzer](https://rauljordan.com/2020/11/01/custom-static-analysis-in-go-part-1.html) which warns the exercise submitter when they commit subtests not meeting the specification.


### Subtest Format Specification

The specification is annotated in the comments of the following example test:
```go
func TestParseCard(t *testing.T) {
  // The table data must be created first
  tests := []struct {
    name string // The name field is required
    card string
    want int
  }{
    // The relevant test data will be parsed out individually for each subtest
    {
      // spaces are fine in a test name, but do not mix them with underscores
      // - because the extraction code won't be able to find it
      name: "parse queen",
      card: "queen",
      want: 10,
    },
    // For example, this element will be parsed for `TestParseCard/parse_king`
    {
      name: "parse king",
      card: "king",
      want: 10,
    },
  }

  // The subtest loop must follow immediately after the table definition
  // The contents of the function literal will be extracted as the test code
  for _, tt := range tests {
    // The Run() call must be the first statement in the for loop
    t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
      // This code block will be pulled into the resulting test_code field
      if got := ParseCard(tt.card); got != tt.want {
        t.Errorf("ParseCard(%s) = %d, want %d", tt.card, got, tt.want)
      }
    })
  }
}
```

The test code above will result in the following `test_code` field, corresponding to the test named `TestParseCard/parse_queen`:
```go
tt := struct {
  name string
  card string
  want int
}{
  name: "parse queen",
  card: "queen",
  want: 10,
}
if got := ParseCard(tt.card); got != tt.want {
  t.Errorf("ParseCard(%s) = %d, want %d", tt.card, got, tt.want)
}
```
